"""Agent turn execution — one place that knows how to run a turn with tools.

Two transports for the same behavior:

- Native: providers with tool support get a web_search tool; the loop
  executes each requested search and feeds results back until the agent
  produces its final text.
- Sentinel: other providers request searches with [SEARCH: query] tags;
  the loop extracts them, runs them, and re-prompts once with the results.

Either way, search results reach the agent within the same turn.
